title: "Lavender"
---

- 1 cup water
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp dried lavender (and a little sprinkle extra - the lil sprinkle makes a difference for some reason)

## Method

1. Put sugar, lavender, water in saucepan, mix, bring to a boil. I like to let it sit there and boil for like a minute, make sure all sugar is dissolved.
2. Turn off heat, bring to room temp to cool. I like to leave my syrup to steep overnight and drain the next day, the flavor is stronger that way.
3. Pour into desired container and store in the fridge for longevity!

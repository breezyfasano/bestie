## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 teaspoons matcha powder

- 1 tablespoon hot water

- 2 teaspoons honey, or to taste

- 3/4 cup hot milk (if you can't heat it up, cold but frothed is fine)


## Method 

1. Scoop the matcha powder into a cup.

2. Add the water and stir until no lumps remain. Stir in the honey.

3. Add the milk and serve. If using frothed milk, pour some of the milk over the matcha and 'fold' it over using a spoon, reserving a small amount of milk. Add the rest of the milk over it and try to make a really cute design but probably fail because that shit is hard.

<strong>Desk French Press Capacity:</strong> 12oz

</div>

## Espresso Strength
A stronger brew of coffee. Good for making drinks (like lattes) that are mostly milk.

- ~5.5oz of water
- 2.5 scoops of ground coffee

## Regular Ol' Coffee
Perfect for drinking black or with your favorite (non-dairy) milk and sweetener of choice.

- ~10.5oz (1 1/4 cup) of water
- 2.5 scoops of ground coffee


## Method

- Start the hot water kettle!
- Scoop required amount of coffee in the bottom of the french press.
- After the water is done heating, pour in the approximate amount of water within reference to the 12oz french press total capacity (if you don't have a measuring cup). You dont have to be exact with the grounds to water ratio, just make sure the coffee in the french press doesn't look too lightly colored. It should be really dark brown.
- Put the top of the press on, making sure the lid lever is pulled all the way up and the opening on the side of the top part (with the slits) matches up with the spout on the carafe.
- Set a timer for 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
- After the timer is done, push down the lever, pour into a mug, and enjoy.

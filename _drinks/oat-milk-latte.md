## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of coffee from the french press (espresso strength)
- One flavoring of choice (See bottom of page for flavoring options)
- Oat milk to taste, at least 1/2 cup (the main event)
- Milk frother

## Method 

1. Pour the desired amount of coffee into a large mug.
2. Pour desired amount of oat milk into your frothing jug. Remember, it's going to expand a lot as you froth it. So if you don't know how much to put, less is more and assume it will more than double in size. You can always make more!
3. Turn on frother and froth milk until it is your desired level of fluffiness.
4. Pour some of the frothed milk over the coffee and 'fold' it over using a spoon, reserving a small amount of milk. Add the rest of the milk over it and try to make a really cute design but probably fail because that shit is hard.
